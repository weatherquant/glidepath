      #    The three funds shown have the same mean return, however the fund values at the end of the period vary dramatically.
      #    This is due to the significant exposure funds in the decumulation phase of their journey have to the order of returns.
      #    It is important to be aware of the dangers posed by sequencing risk as good returns in the early years of drawdown plays a large roles
      #    in prolonging the length of time that drawdown can occur."
